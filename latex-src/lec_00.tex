\begin{definition}[Sequential Decision Making Problem]
    A sequential decision making problem can be modelled as follows 
    $$s_0,x_0,w_{1},\dots,s_t,x_t,w_{t+1},\dots,s_T$$
    where $s_t$ is the \textit{state at time t}, $x_t$ is the \textit{decision variable} which defines the set of choices to be made at $x_t$, and $w_{t+1}$ is the \textit{random exogenous information} that arrives after decision $x_t$ is made.
\end{definition}
